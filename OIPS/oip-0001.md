<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged OIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new OIPs. Note that an OIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your OIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `OIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.

# Branded Token [PLACEHOLDER DRAFT]

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the OIP.-->
A Branded Token allows a mainstream application to create a value-backed
utility token designed specifically for its application's context.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Owners of a balance of a Branded Token (BT) must be able to redeem the underlying
value that is associated with the Branded Token. A Branded Token is only usable
within the application context. The application can maintain a policy on
accepting new BT holders (registered application users, KYC, etc.)

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for OIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the OIP solves. OIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

### An Internal Economy
It should be possible to restrict the use of an application's utility token
to the application context.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for OIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other OIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any OIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the OIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
